#Are We There Yet
###created by: John Fernandes

This application allows the user to enter their current location and end destination which then determines the driving distance between the two locations. 

The project utilizes the [Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) to fetch the distance between the two locations. Features such as event listeners, the Volley HTTP request library and the android JSON Parser were also used.
